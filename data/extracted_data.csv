Their case has now been appealed by the country's government. If the final verdict swings in their favour, it will have ramifications not just for Australian law but for climate cases world-wide. "", 'In May this year, Anjali Sharma was sitting in her economics class at school in Melbourne when the court in Sydney live-streamed the results of a climate case she had found herself at the centre of. It took a while to sink in. ', '""To me it all just sounded like jargon. It took a briefing from my legal team to understand the magnitude of what had happened,"" she says. ', ""At that moment 17-year-old Ms Sharma and the seven other teenagers involved in her case had made history. Alongside 87-year-old Catholic nun Brigid Arthur, who acted as the young people's legal guardian, they'd taken Australia's environment minister, Sussan Ley, to court - and won."", '""It felt really rewarding to be able to engage in something so historic for Australia, and needed too,"" says Ms Sharma.', 'Their case attempted to stop the expansion of the Vickery coal mine in New South Wales, which is estimated to add an extra 170 million tonnes of fossil fuel emissions to the atmosphere. ', ""The judge in their case, Mordy Bromberg, ruled that the government had a duty to protect young people against future harm related to climate change. It's the first time in the world that a duty of care of this kind has been recognised."", ""Justice Bromberg did not, however, grant them an injunction to prevent the expansion of the mine. In his view, the court didn't have any evidence that Sussan Ley would actually approve the extension, and any injunction would be pre-emptive."", 'Yet in September Ms Ley approved the extension of the Vickery coal mine, as well as three others since then. The government is also appealing the decision in the Sharma case - the outcome of which is due soon.', 'The government used a ""substitution argument"" as one reason to approve Vickery, says the lawyer representing the Sharma case, David Barnden.', '""It\'s the argument that if this particular coal project didn\'t go ahead, it wouldn\'t make a difference to the total amount of emissions because effectively the market would fulfill that demand. That\'s otherwise known as the drug dealer\'s defence - it\'s the idea that \'If I don\'t deal drugs then somebody else will.\'""', 'For Sister Brigid Arthur, the minister\'s decisions since the success of their case are ""quite provocative"".', ""Sister Arthur has spent a lifetime working with young people. For over two decades she has been acting as a litigation guardian - instructing lawyers on behalf of those who can't represent themselves - in cases mostly involving refugees. Before that she was a secondary school teacher. This is her first environmental case. "", '""It\'s engaged young people in a way that seems quite extraordinary. It\'s certainly for me something new,"" she says.', ""She was approached by lawyers just over a year ago who asked her to act as the teenagers' litigation guardian. She didn't take much convincing."", '""I\'m pretty passionate about climate change and while I don\'t work directly in this area, I\'m very conscious of the fact that it\'s important for people to do what they can.', '""Young people are the ones who will inherit whatever we\'re doing now, so they have every right to be calling people to account.""', 'In speaking out, Ms Sharma has made herself a target for attacks.', '""I\'ve been messaged a lot of threats,"" she says.', '""Some of the big news sources in Australia have, I guess, quite a right-wing following, so when news sources like that have covered my story I learned really quickly not to read the comments.""', ""A 2019 report which investigated four publications owned by Australia's most powerful media company, News Corp Australia, argued that they promoted climate scepticism. Of over 8,000 articles analysed, 45% of all items either rejected or cast doubt upon consensus scientific findings."", 'In response, a News Corp Australia spokesman said the year-old report was ""imbalanced"" and coming from ""a political activist group with a history of bias against our company\'s journalism"".', 'News Corp Australia recently has been viewed as softening its hostility towards climate action by advocating for net zero emissions by 2050.', 'Despite this, shortly before and during COP26, videos from News Corp-owned Sky News Australia were recycled and found traction on social media amongst climate sceptics.', 'One Sky News Australia segment in which the host condemns youth climate activists as ""selfish, badly educated, virtue-signalling little turds"" was shared by the head of the advocacy group the CO2 coalition and received over 45,000 likes and 16,000 retweets.', 'As the science of climate change has become harder to argue with, a growing and common tactic is often to shoot the messenger instead - often accusing them of hypocrisy.

I do own a pair of jeans. But me not owning that pair of jeans is not going to cut Australia\'s emissions in half by 2030.""', 'Why Australia refuses to give up coalHow climate politics is bitterly contested', 'When Sister Brigid first met the teenagers, who knew each other through attending climate protests, she was struck by their passion. She describes them as a group of young people ""who really believe in this, who feel like they can\'t stop"".', '""There are very few greys with young people,"" she says. ""Everything is so black and white.""', 'But for now, all they can do is wait for the result of the appeal to be announced.', 'Despite widespread recognition of the need to move away from coal, there are different approaches when it comes to putting that knowledge into practice. At the COP26 summit in Glasgow, coal became a point of contention after delegates from China and India requested a last-minute change to the agreement, switching the phrase ""phase out"" coal with ""phase down"".', 'The results of the appeal and their case could be game-changing - not only for Australia but for other parts of the world too.', ""A success in their case could signal an erosion in support for fossil fuel burning and extraction with more lawsuits of this kind ahead. But if the minister's appeal is successful, it could see courts effectively vacate the climate field."", 'Australia is the world\'s second-largest exporter of coal. Following the Glasgow summit, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the coal industry will be operating in the country for ""decades to come"". He added that the plan to achieve net zero by 2050 will not come at the cost of rural and regional Australians. ', '""The world is grappling with this collective action problem of climate change. Every mine has its part to play and every decision counts,"" says Mr Barnden.', '""What the court found was that the emissions from this particular extension project could be the emissions that tip us over the edge to these nonlinear tipping points which would further accelerate climate change.""', 'He hopes that the duty of care ruling - if maintained through the appeal process - can influence other jurisdictions and give hope to young people to be able to participate in the legal process.', '""It\'s a very foundational legal case to approach the problems caused by climate change, and the principles of negligence exist in a whole range of common law countries, from the UK, to New Zealand, Canada and the US as well.""', ""It's too soon to tell whether this case will provide a turning point on climate inaction. But for Ms Sharma and the other teenagers involved in her case, the time for action is now."", '""I really hope the federal court realises that Australia is now running behind the rest of the world, and that the duty of care that my case seeks to establish is really, really needed right now.""']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/101B0/production/_121986956_b8af69c5-0dc7-4193-85c4-3b5530ef07c8.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4039/production/_121914461_gettyimages-1310017393.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/446E/production/_122081571_anj2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16B7/production/_122051850_coalaustralia.jpg']"

The reservoir had reached capacity in February, rather than the middle of the year, as usually happened.', 'Scientists again suggested that the event fitted into the paradigm of a warming world.', 'Speaking at the time to the Guardian newspaper, Prof Roger Bale, from the University of California Merced, explained: ""With a warmer climate, we get these winter storms, which dump rain rather than snow.""', 'The United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) said that the ""frequency and intensity of droughts, storms and extreme weather events are increasingly likely above 1.5C (above pre-industrial levels)"".', ""Failure to keep the global average temperature rise to below 1.5C, as outlined in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, is likely to result in more of the world's reservoirs or flood defences being tested to breaking point."", ""This is a stark warning for world leaders, who will be gathering once again this year at the UN's annual climate summit (COP26) - to be held in Glasgow. "", 'The meeting, which had to be postponed by a year because of Covid, will seek to raise global ambition on tackling climate change - with a view to keeping temperature rise within the 1.5C limit.', 'Our Planet Then and Now will continue up to the UN climate summit in Glasgow, which is due to start in November 2021']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/060A/production/_117364510_us_drought_map_x2_640-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0336/production/_94622800_5f1cbc51-1ec5-42fe-94d3-f1a07d9b856f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1512A/production/_117341368_ef3ad828-55e7-4421-988e-e22fc457e22f.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/102EA/production/_117328266_43248a98-1dce-4eea-ba4d-24149bdb17da.jpg']"
19,https://www.bbc.com//news/science-environment-56902340,By Mark KinverEnvironment reporter,2021-05-01T23:10:52.000Z,Then and now: When silence descended over Victoria Falls,"['In our monthly feature, Then and Now, we reveal some of the ways that planet Earth has been changing against the backdrop of a warming world. Here, we look at the effects of global heating on Victoria Falls, one of the natural wonders of the world - and how Sub-Saharan Africa is learning to cope with the climate crisis.', 'In full flow, Victoria Falls easily qualifies as one of the natural wonders of the world. Spanning 1.7km at its widest point and with a height of more than 100m, locals refer to Africa\'s greatest waterfall as ""the smoke that thunders"".', 'This amazing feature is formed as the Zambezi river plunges into a chasm called the First Gorge. The chasm was carved by the action of water along a natural fracture zone in the volcanic rock that makes up the landscape in this region of southern Africa.', 'In 2019, however, Victoria Falls was silenced.', 'In a drought described as the worst in a century, the flow of the Zambezi was reduced to a relative trickle and the Falls ran dry.', ""As one of the region's biggest attractions for tourists, Victoria Falls is a valuable source of income for Zimbabwe and Zambia. As news of the low waters spread, local traders noticed a visible drop in tourist numbers."", ""As well as hitting the countries' economies, it also hit electricity supplies, which are dependent on hydroelectric generation."", 'More widely across the region, agencies reported an increase in the need for food aid, as crops failed in the drought.', 'A single extreme weather event cannot, in isolation, be viewed as a consequence of climate change. ', ""But the region is recording a sequence of extreme droughts that reflect what climate modellers have predicted will occur as a result of an increase in greenhouse gases in the world's atmosphere as a result of human activity."", 'Zambia\'s President, Edgar Lungu - speaking at the time - called it ""a stark reminder of what climate change is doing to our environment"".', 'Observers of weather patterns in the Zambezi Basin believe the changing climate is resulting in a delay to the monsoon season, concentrating the rains into bigger, more intense events. ', 'This makes the storage of the water in the region more difficult, and makes the impact of the extended dry season more damaging to people and the environment.', ""The UN's State of the Climate in Africa in 2019 report painted a worrying picture for a continent that could see its population double over the coming century."", 'Speaking at the report\'s launch in October 2020, World Meteorological Organization secretary-general Petteri Taalas observed: ""Climate change is having a growing impact on the African continent, hitting the most vulnerable hardest, and contributing to food insecurity, population displacement and stress on water resources.', '""In recent months, we have seen devastating floods, an invasion of desert locusts and now face the looming spectre of drought because of a La Niña event.""', 'The report adds that 2019 was among the three warmest years on record for the continent. ', 'It warns that the warming trend is expected to continue. ', ""The worrying fact facing politicians, policymakers and civil society is that the continent is set to be hardest hit by climate change, yet the continent's capacity to adapt to the realities of a warming world are low."", 'Areas of concern include water supplies, health, food security, droughts and floods, biodiversity. It is a list of concerns that is continuing to grow.', 'Africa is on the front line of the battle against dangerous climate change.', 'Our Planet Then and Now will continue each month up to the UN climate summit in Glasgow, which is scheduled to start in November 2021']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1555/production/_110116450_gettyimages-93066205.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FDDB/production/_118278946_48d6e4a1-c4be-472d-b515-88db446375fa-2.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13AC7/production/_106138508_afp_un_moz.jpg']"
